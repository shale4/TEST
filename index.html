      <h2>What is climate change?</h2>
      <p>Climate change is the long term change in global temperature and weather patterns caused by human impact. The effects of climate change can vary from as much as more rainy days to many more major hurricanes and tornadoes that wipe out parts of countries. Climate change can cause effects all around the world such as higher temperatures, drought, higher sea levels, more severe storms, habitats and environments to be destroyed, and species to become extinct.</p>

      <h2>Why does climate change matter?</h2>
      <p>Climate change matters as it threatens the existence of humankind and the planet we live on. Even though our generation may not see the full consequences and effects of climate change, that doesn't mean future generations won't. Studying and analysing climate change is a key step to understanding and predicting how climate change will increase and change the future. Not only does climate change affect environments and animals, but it also affects our food sources and farmers growing the food. This is why climate change must be taken more seriously and taken action against. </p>
