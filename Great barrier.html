      <h2>About the great barrier reef</h2>
      <p>The great barrier reef is the largest coral reef system in the world which is located just off the coast of Queensland, Australia. The coral reef is home to over 5,000 species of animals and stretches over 2,300km of the coastline. The great barrier reef is quite famous as it is the only living structure on earth that is visible from space and the reef is also the only place on earth where two UNESCO world heritage sites meet. </p>

      <h2>How the great barrier reef is affected by climate change</h2>
      <p>The great barrier reef is at risk due to climate change as severe weather caused by climate change is resulting in much of the coral reef being destroyed. There have been 10 cyclones that hit the great barrier reef between 2004 and 2018 causing lots of damage. Another impact of climate change is rising temperatures causing the coral to go through a process called coral bleaching. Coral bleaching is when coral suffers from immense heat and expel all its colour and algae making them more vulnerable to disease and starvation.</p>
