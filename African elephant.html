      <h2>About the African Elephant</h2>
      <p>The African elephant is a type of elephant from African countries that live in the forests and grasslands. The African elephant is a herbivore and primarily eats roots and grasses. The African elephant has two species, the grasslands elephant and the forest elephant both living in their respective habitats. This kind of elephant is much larger than the regular elephant making it the largest walking animal on earth. They can grow up to 11 feet in height, 19-24 feet in length, and weigh around 6 tons. There is estimated to be around 415,000 African elephants in the wild.</p>

      <h2>How the African Elephant is affected by climate change</h2>
      <p>As African elephants live in very harsh environments, they have adapted and changed to overcome complications that they may face while surviving. Throughout the species' adaptations, they have gained many useful traits that help them to survive, however they are vulnerable to the rapid temperature caused by climate change. They are also vulnerable to disease and lack of freshwater which is also caused by climate change. As they are at risk due to climate change and also have a slow reproductive rate, climate change will most likely cause many African elephants to die.</p>
