      <h2>About the green sea turtle</h2>
      <p>The green sea turtle is a species of large sea turtle found in most warm and tropical oceans. The green sea turtle is an aquatic reptile that is a strict herbivore. They can weigh from 150-300 pounds and can be as long as 31-47 inches. The green sea turtle is currently classified as endangered due to habitat loss, fishing bycatch, climate change, and poaching. Green sea turtles play a vital role in keeping seagrass and algae more productive by grazing on them which helps multiple species of fish that live in seagrass beds.</p>

      <h2>How the green sea turtle is affected by climate change</h2>
      <p>The green sea turtles are at risk due to the harsh weather and high-temperature effects of climate change and global warming. As sea turtles live in reefs, beaches, and warm oceans sea turtles are at risk due to climate change is causing harsh storms and sea-level rise which is destroying the sea turtles' natural habitats. The rising temperatures are also causing ocean currents to change which could put the sea turtles in even more danger to more predators. The green sea turtle species is at risk of extinction as there are only around 85,000 nesting females left in the wild. </p>
