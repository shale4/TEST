      <h2>About the Alps</h2>
      <p>The alps are the highest mountain range in all of Europe located across countries such as France, Italy, and Austria. The Alps' highest peak is as high as 15,776 feet high. The Alps is home to many species of animals such as goats, owls, and cats. The alps also have many species of trees and other plants such as oaks and elms that grow at the base of the mountains. The Alps stretch out almost 1200km and has a width of around 250 km.</p>

      <h2>How the Alps are affected by climate change</h2>
      <p> Since the Alps are a snowy mountain range, permafrost has held the rocky mountains together for thousands of years, however, due to climate change, part of the permafrost has started to melt causing parts of the mountains to erode and collapse. This has made many paths and trails used by people inaccessible and closed. This has also forced many of the species of animals living on the mountains to move further up as their habitats are being slowly destroyed by the effects of climate change.</p>
