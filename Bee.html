      <h2>About bees</h2>
      <p>Bees are very common winged insects that live all around the world. Bees play a key part in pollination and honey production which makes them a very important species of insect. Bees live in large groups and form hives in which they produce honey and protect a queen bee. Although most honey bees only live for around 30 days, on average one honey bee can produce one teaspoon of honey in its life. As bees are useful pollinators, they are very essential at helping farmers grow food meaning most of the food we eat would not exist without bees.</p>

      <h2>How bees are affected by climate change</h2>
      <p>Due to climate change, many weather and seasonal patterns have drastically changed. Since bees rely on the weather, plants, and the climate to survive, many bees have been disrupted and killed and will continue to do so. Bees are very structured and organized insects and follow a routine to keep the queen and hive alive but as climate change continues, each year many plant species start to bloom earlier. After many years of this building up, many plant species are now blooming up to a month earlier than they normally do. this will eventually cause bees to become very out of sync with many species of plants causing plants to be unpollinated and bees to be left without food.</p>
