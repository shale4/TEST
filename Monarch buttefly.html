      <h2>About the monarch butterfly</h2>
      <p>The monarch butterfly is a species of butterfly primarily found in North America. The butterfly has bright orange and black coloured wings which makes it easily identifiable. The monarch butterfly has a very long annual migration period when the butterfly will fly across the country to escape cooler weather. They will then migrate back so they can reproduce and lay eggs. Once the eggs are laid, they will hatch into caterpillars, eat and grow, turn into a chrysalis, and then finally turn into butterflies to repeat the lifecycle. </p>

      <h2>How the monarch butterfly is affected by climate change</h2>
      <p>The monarch butterfly heavily relies on weather patterns to tell itself when to migrate to avoid harsh climates. However, due to climate change, the weather and weather patterns are very altered causing the monarch butterfly to be disrupted in key stages in their life cycle. This causes population loss of monarch butterflies and could lead to monarch butterflies becoming scarce. Not only are monarch butterflies affected by changing weather, but they are also affected by their habitats being dried up and destroyed by the rising temperatures.</p>
